# Up to and including 1000 cubic feet                               $15.00 flat rate
# Over 1,000 cubic feet and up to and including 2,000 cubic feet    $0.0175 per cubic foot
# Over 2,000 cubic feet and up to and including 3,000 cubic feet    $0.02 per cubic foot
# Over 3,000 cubic feet                                             $70.00 flat rate
